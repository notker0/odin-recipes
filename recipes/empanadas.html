        <h5><strong>Ingredients</strong></h5>

            <li>Flour</li>

        <h5><strong>Steps</strong></h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare surface with flour and place empanada dough on top.</li>
            <li>Put chosen filling in the middle of the dough and fold one side to meet with the other, hotdog style.</li>
            <li>Use fork or pressing utensil to knead together the edge seam of the empanada, bringing it together and securing the filling inside.</li>
            <li>Stab through the middle of the empanada with your fork to make 3-4 small holes in the center.</li>
            <li>Flip the empanada and repeat step 3 & 4.</li>
            <li>Repeat for all empanadas that you're frying.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a pan at medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once hot, put 2-3 empanadas in at a time to fry them. They cook quickly so only about 1-2 minutes per side and they should be done.</li>
